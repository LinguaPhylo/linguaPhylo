\section*{Abstract}
  Phylogenetic models have become increasingly complex and the data sets addressed larger and more rich.
  Yet there is no succinct language to accurately specify the details of a phylogenetic model for the purposes of reproducibility or reuse.
  We present a new language to specify the details of a phylogenetic model that is both human and machine readable.
  We also report on the development of a graphical software package that can be used to construct and simulate data from
  models in this new language, as well as create natural language narratives that can form the basis of a description of the model for the method section of a manuscript.
  Finally we report on a command-line program that can be used to generate XML for the BEAST2 software package based
  on a model specified in this new language.
  These tools together should aid in the goal of reproducibility and reuse of probabilistic phylogenetic models.

\section*{Introduction}

Transparency is a scientific ideal, and replicability and
reproducibility lie at the heart of the scientific endeavor
\cite{nas19,munafo17}.
Despite this being a non-contentious point, only recently have
systematic examinations of the literature begun to reveal that
reproducibility is largely overlooked in pratice.
Metaresearch efforts have uncovered the so-called ``reproducibility
crisis'' \cite{baker16} in many scientific domains (but see
\cite{fanelli18}), among which the dimension of the problem varies
\cite{openscience15,camerer16}.
Reproducing a scientific finding can be hindered by data being
unavailable, for example, with many journals now adopting the
countermeasure of requiring data to be deposited in cloud 
repositories (e.g., Dryad, Figshare, Zenodo) upon
submission.
Another barrier to reproducibility is the complexity of
data-preparation and analytical protocols. 
The more technical protocols are, the harder it is to accurately
report and re-execute them.

Within evolutionary biology, phylogenetics is one discipline that has
become highly technical over the last few decades.
The publication of new, complex phylogenetic models happens on a
regular basis, which is reflected in the myriad of computational tools
implementing them.
A large number of these tools fall within one of two methodological
families: methods whose main goal is to reconstruct phylogenetic trees 
(e.g.,
\cite{mrbayes,mcmctree,mpest,phyml,svdquartets,raxml,iqtree,astral3,svdquest}),
and those aiming at characterizing what drives among-clade differences
 in species number or in the traits those species exhibit (e.g.,
\cite{diversitree,phytools,bamm,geiger,mvmorph,rpanda,bite,cafe}).
The narrower focus of these tools makes specifying and reproducing
analyses relatively easier, but this often comes at a cost of (i)
information loss, as some types of data are thrown away because they
are not modelled, (ii) lack of realism or generality in the
implemented models, which can lead to model misspecification
\cite{mendes17,mendes18}, and (iii) failing to capture uncertainty in  
parameter estimates (e.g., analyses that treat the phylogeny as data).

As opposed to the two classes of methods mentioned above, a third
family of phylogenetic tools (e.g., BEAST, BEAST 2 and RevBayes;
\cite{beast,beast2,revbayes}) can simultaneously attain both the goal
of reconstructing phylogenetic tree(s) (topology and divergence
times), as well as that of estimating macroevolutionary and trait
evolution parameters.
Common denominators among these programs include the wide variety of
models they implement, but more distinctively, the large number of
ways these models can be combined.
The latter arises organically from Bayesian inference -- the
statistical approach all these tools share -- more specifically from
the relative ease with which hierarchical Bayesian models can be 
built and their parameters sampled (with Markov chain Monte Carlo,
MCMC).
Moreover, another key advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it
accounts for the uncertainty around parameter estimates.

Variety and flexibility in model specification means Bayesian software
platforms like BEAST, BEAST 2 and RevBayes can be used to address a
wide range of phylogenetic problems. 
These include species tree inference from living and extinct taxa
using molecular and morphological data
\cite{gavryushkina17,ogilvie21,zhang21}, reconstruction of ancestral
biogeographical ranges \cite{lemey10,landis18} and ecological networks
\cite{braga20}, characterizing the tempo and mode of trait evolution
\cite{may19,bite}, and estimating 
relevant dates, locations, and rates of epidemic spread
\cite{faria21,douglas21}, to name a few. 
* now difficulty in setting up analyses and reproducing.

* BEAST and BEAST 2 decided to use XML, which contains all you need,
but it's illegible when models are complex. RevBayes made progress in
creating a language that allows the flexible definition of models.
Rev has a learning curve because it is an actual scripting language;
the user is also exposed to non-model decisions, like operators, MCMC
chain lengths. Rev also only works for RevBayes and is limited to the
models therein.
Finally, low interoperability.

* We introduce a language for model specification that is intended to
sit outside BEAST, BEAST 2 and RevBayes, and which focuses exclusively
on model specification.
The ultimate goals are (i) facilitate model description, which enhances
the user understanding of the analysis, (ii) inference runs, (iii)
make reproducibility possible, (iv) assist with simulations under the
model for different purposes, like validation or model comparison.
LPhy is accompanied by LPhyBEAST and LPhyStudio.
It is also accompanied by documentation and tutorials.

% A new paradigm for scientific computing and data science has begun to
% emerged in the last decade.
% A recent example is the publication of the
% first ``computationally reproducible article'' using eLife's
% Reproducible Document Stack which blends features of a traditional
% manuscript with live code, data and interactive figures.

% Although standard tools for statistical phylogenetics provide a degree
% of reproducibility and reusability through popular open-source
% software and computer-readable data file formats, there is still much
% to do.
% The ability to construct and accurately communicate
% probabilistic models in phylogenetics is frustratingly
% underdeveloped.
% There is low interoperability between different
% inference packages (e.g. BEAST1, BEAST2, MrBayes, RevBayes), and the
% file formats that these software use have low readability for
% researchers.

% In this paper we describe two related projects, LinguaPhylo (LPhy for
% short) and LPhyBEAST.

\section*{Design and Implementation}

\subsection*{A concise domain-specific language for phylogenetic inference}

LinguaPhylo is a model specification language to concisely and
precisely define probabilistic phylogenetic models.
The aim is to work
towards a common language for probabilistic models of phylogenetic
evolution.
This language should be readable by both humans and
computers.
Box \ref{box1} shows a simple example.

%\end{minipage}

\item Posterior

$$P(\psi, \lambda | D) \propto P(D | \psi) P(\psi | \lambda) P(\lambda) $$

\end{enumerate}

\end{mybox}

Each of the lines in this model specification expresses how a random
variable (to the left of the tilde) is generated by a generative
distribution to the right.

The first line creates a random variable (\texttt{lambda}), that is
log-normally distributed.
The second line creates a tree (\texttt{tree}) with 16 taxa from the
Yule process with a lineage birth rate equal to \texttt{lambda}.
The third line produces a multiple sequence alignment (\texttt{D})
with a length of 200, by simulating a Jukes Cantor model of sequence
evolution down the branches of  \texttt{tree}.
As you can see, each of the random variables depends on the previous,
so this is a hierarchical model that ultimately defines a probability
distribution over sequence alignments of size $16 \times 200$.

To construct an analysis of a data set with this model we add a data block:

{\small
\begin{alltt}
data \{
  D = \textcolor{magenta!80!black}{readNexus}(\textcolor{gray}{file=}\textcolor{magenta}{"data/primate.nex"});
  L = D.\textcolor{magenta!80!black}{nchar}();
  taxa = D.\textcolor{magenta!80!black}{taxa}();
\}
model \{
  \textcolor{green}{lambda} ~ \textcolor{blue}{LogNormal}(\textcolor{gray}{meanlog=}\textcolor{magenta}{3.0}, \textcolor{gray}{sdlog=}\textcolor{magenta}{1.0});
  \textcolor{green}{tree} ~ \textcolor{blue}{Yule}(\textcolor{gray}{lambda=}\textcolor{green}{lambda}, \textcolor{gray}{taxa=}taxa);
  \textcolor{green}{D} ~ \textcolor{blue}{PhyloCTMC}(\textcolor{gray}{L=}L, \textcolor{gray}{Q=}\textcolor{magenta!80!black}{jukesCantor}(), \textcolor{gray}{tree=}\textcolor{green}{tree});
\}
\end{alltt}}

These two blocks of statements contain all the information needed to define
a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of a multiple sequence alignment.
The data block may contain literals, and deterministic values, including those read in from a file, but not random variables or generative distributions.
The model block contains all random variables, generative distributions and boundary conditions that define the model.
If a value in the data block has the same name as a random variable in the model block, then that signifies that the data block value is an observation of the random variable with the same name.


So by assigning the alignment in file
``data/primate.nex'' to the name D in the data block we are saying that the random variable in the model named D has
been observed, and we will infer all the other random variables
(tree and lambda in this example) in the model from that observed sequence alignment.

\subsection*{Language features}

LinguaPhylo has two main components: Values (which can be either constant or random variables, and either objects or primitives) and Generators (which can be either generative distributions, deterministic functions or method calls).

\subsection*{Values}

Values in LinguaPhylo represent either random variables or constants. The type system of LinguaPhylo is open and can be extended by adding types to the Java implementation of LPhy. The types already developed include standard primitive types such as Double, Integer, String and Boolean, as well as some more complex types such as TimeTree and Alignment.

\subsection*{Primitive constants}

The simplest type of value in LinguaPhylo is a primitive constant such in the following example. The first line defines a constant named `a' with a value of `2.0'. There is no explicit statement of the type, which is simply inferred to be a Double because the literal string `2.0' has a fractional component. The second constant `b' here is a constant of type Integer because it has no decimal point or fractional component. The third constant is of primitive type Boolean, inferred by the keyword `true'. the last constant is of type String because of the double quotes surrounding the literal value.

{\singlespacing
\begin{alltt}
  a = 2.0;
  b = 2;
  c = true;
  d = "lphy";
\end{alltt}
}

\subsection*{Arrays}

The notion of primitives can be extended to arrays and to declare a constant array you can enclose comma-delimited literals in square brackets as shown below. For sequences of consecutive integers a more compact notation can be employed using the `:' to define a range. In the example below a and b represent the same constant array containing the consecutive integers from 1 to 10 inclusive.

\begin{alltt}
  a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  b = 1:10;
\end{alltt}

\subsection*{Generative distributions}

A generative distribution generates a named random variable which has a value that is either an object or a primitive type. Some generative distributions have parameters which have argument labels:

{\singlespacing
\begin{alltt}
  lambda ~ LogNormal(meanlog=3.0, sdlog=1.0);
\end{alltt}
}

\subsection*{Deterministic functions}

A deterministic function generates either an object or a primitive value that is a deterministic function of its arguments. If the function has a single argument then no argument label is needed, otherwise arguments are labelled in the same way as for generative distributions. In the code below the function named hky takes two parameters with argument labels `kappa' and `freq' and deterministically produces an instantaneous rate matrix using those values.

{\singlespacing
\begin{alltt}
  Q = hky(kappa=2.0, freq=[0.2, 0.25, 0.4, 0.15]);
\end{alltt}
}

\subsection*{Vectorization}

LinguaPhylo has built-in vectorization so that any distribution or function can be called with a vectorized form of its arguments to produce multiple values from the generator. There are two vectorization patterns: IID and vectorized argument. The following code demonstrates both:

{\singlespacing
\begin{alltt}
  n = 3;
  \textcolor{green}{\(\kappa\)} ~ \textcolor{blue}{LogNormal}(\textcolor{gray}{sdlog=}\textcolor{magenta}{0.5}, \textcolor{gray}{meanlog=}\textcolor{magenta}{1.0}, \textcolor{gray}{replicates=}n);
  \textcolor{green}{\(\pi\)} ~ \textcolor{blue}{Dirichlet}(\textcolor{gray}{conc=}[\textcolor{magenta}{2.0}, \textcolor{magenta}{2.0}, \textcolor{magenta}{2.0}, \textcolor{magenta}{2.0}], \textcolor{gray}{replicates=}n);
  \textcolor{black}{Q = }\textcolor{magenta!80!black}{hky}(\textcolor{gray}{kappa=}\textcolor{green}{\(\kappa\)}, \textcolor{gray}{freq=}\textcolor{green}{\(\pi\)});

\end{alltt} 

The first two lines of this code use the IID pattern, which involves adding a replicates argument of type integer to any generative distribution. In the first line this results in a an array of iid doubles being produced from the specified log-normal distribution of length $n = 3$ instead of a single double. The second line similarly produces a 2D array of doubles representing three iid Dirichlet distributions, instead of the normal 1D array that the Dirichlet distribution would normally produce. The final line vectorises the hky funcgtion by passing arguments that are arrays of the normal argument types, resulting in the production of a 3D array representing and array of three iid HKY instantaneous rate matrices.

\subsection*{Tree generative distributions}

There are many statistical programming languages such as Stan
\cite{carpenter2017stan}, JAGS \cite{plummer2003jags} and BUGS \cite{lunn2009bugs, gilks1994language} that provide the possibility
of succinctly describing statistical models. The unique model feature of
phylogenetic analysis is the phylogenetic tree.
This is a complex high-dimensional object, part discrete, part
continuous.
There is no bijection between tree space and Euclidean space, so it
can not be treated with standard statistical distributions.
As a result specialist software is needed to perform inference \cite{hohna2016revbayes,bouckaert2019beastanalysis}.

The aim of LPhy is describe the standard phylogenetic tree
distributions succinctly and precisely, while leaving out trivial algorithmic details related to the method
of inference and the particular software employed to do the inference.

\subsubsection*{Coalescent generative distributions for time trees}

LPhy has describes a family of coalescent generative distributions
that produce TimeTrees.

The simplest model in this package is the one parameter model
constant-population size coalescent.
The generation-time-scaled population size parameter (theta) parameter determines at
what rate, per unit time, a pair of lineages coalesce, backwards in time.

\subsubsection*{Constant population size coalescent model}

In its simplest form \cite{kingman81} the coalescent model produces a
tree on a fixed number of leaves based on a population size parameter (theta):

\begin{alltt}
  g ~ Coalescent(theta=0.1, n=16);
\end{alltt}

It is also possible to give explicit taxa labels to the generative
distribution:

\begin{alltt}
  g ~ Coalescent(theta=0.1, taxa=["a", "b", "c", "d"]);
\end{alltt}

It is also possible to handle serially-sampled (time-stamped) data by
adding ages.
There are two ways to do that:

Ages without taxa names:

\begin{alltt}
  g ~ Coalescent(theta=0.1, ages=[0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]);
\end{alltt}

Ages and taxa names:

\begin{alltt}
  taxaAges = taxaAges(taxa=["a", "b", "c", "d"], ages=[0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]);
  g ~ Coalescent(theta=0.1, taxaAges=taxaAges);
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection*{Classic skyline coalescent model}

A highly parametric version of the coalescent is also possible, where
a series of theta values are provided, one for each group of consecutive coalescent intervals.
If the groupSizes are specified then each coalescent interval is given its
own population size.
The following code would generate a tree of five taxa, since there are four theta values provided:

\begin{alltt}
  g ~ SkylineCoalescent(theta=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]);
\end{alltt}

The theta values are indexed from the present into the past.
So the first coalescent interval (starting from the leaves)
would be generated assuming a population size parameter of 0.1, while
the last coalescent interval (culimating at the root of the tree)
would be generated from a population size parameter of 0.4.

It is also possible to add taxa and/or taxa age information:

\begin{alltt}
  taxaAges = taxaAges(taxa=["a", "b", "c", "d"], ages=[0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]);
  g ~ SkylineCoalescent(theta=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], taxaAges=taxaAges);
\end{alltt}

This will produce a serial coalescent tree with three distinct epochs
of population size on four taxa with distinct ages.

\subsubsection*{Generalized skyline coalescent model}

The following generative distribution call will produce a tree of size
n=11 taxa, since 4+3+2+1=10= coalescent intervals.
The first four intervals will all have theta=0.1, the next three will
have theta=0.2, the next two will have theta=0.3, and the last
coalescent interval will have theta=0.4:

\begin{alltt}
  g ~ SkylineCoalescent(theta=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], groupSizes=[4,3,2,1]);
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection*{Structured coalescent}

A structured coalescent process takes a migration matrix (M) with
population sizes of each deme on the diagonal:
For K demes, theta is an K-tuple and the dimension of m is $K^2 -
K$. $n$ is a tuple of sample sizes, one dimension for each deme:

\begin{alltt}
  M = migrationMatrix(theta=[0.1, 0.1], m=[1.0, 1.0]);
  g ~ StructuredCoalescent(M=M, n=[15, 15]);
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection*{Multispecies coalescent}

This model allows for gene tree-species tree discordance, and is a
hierarchical model of phylogeny.
A simple multispecies coalescent model has one distribution define a
species tree, and a second distribution define a gene tree based on
the species tree:

\begin{alltt}
  S ~ Yule(lambda=5, n=4);
  theta = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1];
  g ~ MultispeciesCoalescent(theta=theta, n=[2, 2, 2, 2], S=S);
\end{alltt}

Each branch in the species tree has its own theta value.
The $n$ value describes how many individuals are represented in
the gene tree for each species.
It is a tuple of integers with length equal to the number of species
in the species tree.

\subsubsection*{Birth-death process generative distributions of trees}

The other main family of tree distributions is the birth-death-sampling generative distributions.

The simplest model in this family is the one parameter model Yule model \cite{yule1925ii}.
The birth rate (lambda) parameter determines at what rate, per unit time, each lineage bifurcates to produce two daughter lineages.
This describes a pure birth process, so that the number of lineages grows monotonically forward in time.

\subsubsection*{Yule model}

In its simplest form the Yule model has a stopping criterion based on the final number of leaves in the tree.
The following code will generate a random Yule tree with 16 leaves:

\begin{alltt}
  tree ~ Yule(lambda=1.0, n=16);
\end{alltt}

It is also possible to give explicit taxa labels to the generative distribution:

\begin{alltt}
  taxa = 1:16;
  tree ~ Yule(lambda=1.0, taxa=taxa);
\end{alltt}

or

\begin{alltt}
  taxa = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
  tree ~ Yule(lambda=1.0, taxa=taxa);
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection*{Calibrated Yule model}

It is also possible the generate a Yule tree with a given rootAge:

\begin{alltt}
  tree ~ Yule(lambda=1.0, n=16, rootAge=10);
\end{alltt}

This is useful if you want to produce a calibrated analysis where there is a separate prior on the root age of the tree:

\begin{alltt}
  rootAge ~ LogNormal(meanlog=2.0, sdlog=1.0);
  tree ~ Yule(lambda=1.0, n=16, rootAge=rootAge);
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection*{Birth-death model}

The birth-death tree process is a generalisation of the Yule model. A second rate of extinction (mu) is added alongside
the rate of speciation (lambda). Running forward in time it is possible for the number of lineages to both grow and
shrink, and indeed for the tree process to go completely extinct.

\subsubsection*{Calibrated Birth-Death process}

A calibrated birth-death process can be describe like so:

\begin{alltt}
  tree ~ BirthDeath(lambda=2.0, mu=1.0, n=16, rootAge=10);
\end{alltt}

It is important to realise that the resulting tree will contain only the extant lineages. All extinct lineages will be
suppressed. As with the Yule model it is possible to directly specify the taxa names:

\begin{alltt}
  taxa = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
  tree ~ BirthDeath(lambda=2.0, mu=1.0, taxa=taxa, rootAge=10);
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection*{Full birth-death process}

It is possible to generate a full birth-death tree that includes also extinct lineages using the following generative
distribution:

\begin{alltt}
  tree ~ FullBirthDeath(lambda=2.0, mu=1.0, rootAge=10);
\end{alltt}

Note that unlike the BirthDeath generative distribution, this process will generate a tree with a random number of
leaf nodes, both in terms of extinct and extant lineages. The only conditioning is on the root age.

\subsubsection*{Birth-death-sampling process}

A birth-death-sampling process adds a third parameter (rho) the probability of sampling each extant lineage. Again,
only extant lineages are leaves in the resulting tree and extinct lineages are suppressed:

\begin{alltt}
  T ~ BirthDeathSampling(lambda=2.0, mu=1.0, rho=0.5, rootAge=3);
\end{alltt}

An alternative parameterization allows specification of the diversification and turnover rates:

\begin{alltt}
  T ~ BirthDeathSampling(diversification=1.0, turnover=0.5, rho=0.5, rootAge=3);
\end{alltt}

Again it is important to note that the number of tips of the tree is a random variable, and is not conditioned on,
unlike for the BirthDeath generative distribution above.

\subsubsection*{Birth-death-serial-sampling process}

A birth-death-serial-sampling \cite{stadler2013dating} process adds a fourth parameter (psi), the rate of sampling each lineage per unit time.
Now leaves of the tree can either be extinct (psi-sampled) or extant (rho-sampled).

\begin{alltt}
  ages = [0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0];
  tree ~ BirthDeathSerialSampling(lambda=1, mu=0.5, rho=0.1, psi=1, rootAge=5, ages=ages);
\end{alltt}

In this case the number of leaves in the tree, and their ages are conditioned on, so are not random variables.


\subsection*{Models of evolutionary rates and sequence evolution}

Another key distribution necessary to perform phylogenetic inference
is the phylogenetic continuous-time Markov process and its inference
equivalent the phylogenetic likelihood \cite{felsenstein1981}.

In its simplest form the PhyloCTMC generative
distribution takes an instantaneous transition matrix (Q), a number of sites (L) and a tree:

\begin{alltt}
  tree = newick(tree="((A:0.1,B:0.1):0.2,(C:0.15,D:0.15):0.15);");
  D ~ PhyloCTMC(tree=tree, Q=jukesCantor(), L=100);
\end{alltt}

\subsection*{Molecular clock}

If the tree is not in units of substitutions per site, then it is possible to include a molecular clock rate
to scale the branches of the tree from time to substitutions per site. This example will give the same
result as the previous example, but the tree is now in units of time, so the mutation rate (mu) in units of
substitutions per site per unit time is given.

\begin{alltt}
  tree = newick(tree="((A:10,B:10):20,(C:15,D:15):15);");
  D ~ PhyloCTMC(tree=tree, Q=jukesCantor(), L=100, mu=0.01);
\end{alltt}

\subsection*{ Nucleotide substitution models}

There are a number of built in functions to construct standard nucleotide rate matrices. Some examples:

\begin{alltt}
  jc = jukesCantor();
  hky = hky(kappa=2.0, freq=[0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.25]);
  gtr = gtr(rates=[0.1, 0.25, 0.15, 0.15, 0.25, 0.1], freq=[0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.25]);
\end{alltt}

The Dirichlet prior is a natural prior for relative rates and frequencies, so a full model for GTR could
look like this:

\begin{alltt}
  pi ~ Dirichlet(conc=[3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0]); // dirichlet prior on base frequencies
  R ~ Dirichlet(conc=[1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0]); // dirichlet prior on relative rates
  Q = gtr(freq=pi, rates=R); // construct the GTR instantaneous rate matrix
\end{alltt}

\subsection*{ Rate heterogeneity across sites}

The PhyloCTMC generative distribution takes a parameter siteRates to describe rates across sites.
For inference, a common model is the discretized Gamma distribution of site rate heterogeneity (Yang, 1994).

To match this model for simulation in LPHY do the following:

\begin{alltt}
  tree = newick(tree="((A:0.1,B:0.1):0.2,(C:0.15,D:0.15):0.15);");
  siteRates ~ G(shape=0.5, ncat=4, reps=100); // generate 100 site rates from a discretized Gamma
  D ~ PhyloCTMC(tree=tree, Q=jukesCantor(), siteRates=siteRates);
\end{alltt}

\subsection*{  Relaxed clock models (rate heterogeneity across branches) }

The PhyloCTMC generative distribution can also take an optional parameter branchRates to describe the
rates across branches:

\begin{alltt}
  tree = newick(tree="((A:0.1,B:0.1):0.2,(C:0.15,D:0.15):0.15);");
  branchRates = [0.5, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 0.5];
  D ~ PhyloCTMC(L=100, Q=jukesCantor(), tree=tree, branchRates=branchRates);
\end{alltt}

\subsection*{LinguaPhylo Studio}

Along with the language definition, we also provide software to
specify and visualise models as well as simulate data from models
defined in LPhy.

This software will also provide the ability for models specified in
the LPhy language to be applied to data using standard inference tools
such as MrBayes, RevBayes, BEAST1 and BEAST2
\cite{bouckaert2014beastanalysis,DrummondBouckaert2015,bouckaert2019beastanalysis}.
This will require software that can convert an LPhy specification into
an input file that these inference engines understand.
The first such software converter is LPhyBEAST described below.

\subsection*{LPhyBEAST}

LPhyBEAST is a command-line program that takes an LPhy model
specification, and some data and produces a BEAST 2 XML input file.
It is therefore an alternative way to succinctly express and
communicate BEAST analyses.
