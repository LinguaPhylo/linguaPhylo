# META-INF/services must be under src for Intellij
# Class requires a public no-args constructor

# but extensions need to declare what service interface the provider intends to use for new Viewers.
# for example,  lphystudio.app.graphicalmodelpanel.viewer.???Viewer

popsizefunc.lphystudio.viewer.PopSizeFuncViewer
